## Executive Summary
This case study presents a comprehensive analysis of climate data across various global regions over the past decades. Our aim was to uncover trends and insights that can inform policymaking and resource management decisions to mitigate the effects of climate change. Key findings include a significant increase in average temperatures and a noticeable shift in precipitation patterns, which have implications for agriculture, water resources, and overall ecosystem sustainability.

## Introduction and Background
- Understanding the long-term changes in climate patterns globally is vital.
- It will provide critical insights for environmental planning and policy formulation.

## Challenge and Motivation
- High variability and complexity of climate data across different geographical areas pose challenges.
- Urgently needed are comprehensive data-driven strategies to address and adapt to global warming.

## Aim and Objectives
**Aim**
- To analyze historical climate data to identify significant changes and trends.
  
**Objectives**
- Determine the rate of increase in global temperatures.
- Assess changes in precipitation patterns over decades.

## Hypothesis and Research
**Hypothesis** 
- Climate change has significantly altered global temperature and precipitation patterns.
  
**Research Questions**
  1. How have average global temperatures changed over the last century?
  2. What changes in precipitation have been observed during the same period?
  3. Are there correlations among these climate variables?

## Three Key Questions
1. What trends are observed in temperature, CO2 emmission and sea level changes?
2. Will there be noticeable shifts in the next ten years in seasonal weather patterns due to climate change?
3. What relationships do the climate variables show among each other?

## Methodology
**Data Sources** 
- Historical climate data from multiple global monitoring agencies were sourced.
  
**Analysis Techniques**
- Statistical analysis and trend detection were conducted using Python and its data visualization libraries.
- Machine learning technique was applied where the relationship was not clearly detected among the variables.

## Results and Interpretations
**Temperature trends** show a clear upward trend globally, with some regions experiencing more rapid increases.

**Average temperature trend** shows there is a clear upward trend in average temperature over the years.
**CO2 emissions trend** indicates there is an upward trend which correlates with the increase in global average temperatures. 
- This is as a result of evitable consistent rise in CO2 emissions from 1980 to 2022.
**Sea level rise trend** shows there is a clear and steady increase over the years.
- This is as a direct consequence of global warming and the resulting melting of ice and thermal expansion of seawater.

**Forecasts**

- **Average temperature forecast** shows a continuing upward trend.
- **CO2 emissions forecast** indicates a steady rise in CO2 emissions over the next decade.
- **Sea level rise rorecast** continues to rise reflecting the ongoing effects of global warming on ice melt and sea expansion.

- The Dickey-Fuller test statistic is significantly lower than the critical values at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, indicating stationarity.
- The ACF and PACF plots suggest an AR(1) model for temperature data.

- Most variables show weaker correlation to each other! Other factors not observed in the data could be responsible for changes.
 
**Temperature vs. CO2 Emissions** shows a significant peak at lag 0, indicating a strong synchronous relationship.

**Temperature vs. Sea Level:** shows the strongest correlation with sea level at lag 0.

**CO2 Emissions vs. Sea Level:** shows a similar observation; the correlation is highest at lag 0.

## Conclusions
- Climate change is unequivocally affecting global weather patterns; this confirms my initial hypothesis.
- The findings suggest a critical need for enhanced environmental policies and sustainable practices.

## Recommendations
- **Policy makers** should implement stricter emissions regulations to mitigate the effects of climate change.
- **Research** should continue monitoring and analysis of climate data to update and refine strategies.
